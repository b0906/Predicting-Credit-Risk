# Predicting-Credit-Risk
Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. This data will be used to determine whether a borrower is creditworthy and should be issued a loan.
I use this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, I compare the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.



## Steps
* Retrieve the data.
* Import the data using Pandas.
* Consider the models
